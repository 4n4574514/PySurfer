  Python library for visualizing cortical surface representations of
  neuroimaging data.

Introduction
============

PySurfer is primarily intended for use with
`Freesurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_, but it can plot data that
are drawn from a variety of sources. PySurfer extends `Mayavi's
<http://github.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/index.html>`_ powerful rendering
engine with a high-level interface for working with MRI and MEG data.
For more information, see :ref:`intro`.
